## What is frontend testing?

Frontend testing is the process of testing the user interface and functionality of a website or web application. This can include testing the layout of pages, testing for broken links, testing forms and user input, and testing the overall look and feel of the site.

## Why use frontend testing?

By thoroughly testing the frontend, you can continuously ensure that (among others);
1. The views look good across different devices/browsers.
2. Logical functions execute correctly and return the expected result.
3. The views correctly change when you (for example) press a button or add an item to a list.
4. Certain views behave differently or don't show at all depending on if authorized or not.

The big advantage of doing it with automatic tests instead of just walking through the application yourself is that you will need to test your application continuously. Every time someone changes any part of the application or any of the frameworks you use has an update, you obviously don't want to have to walk through the entire application. Instead, it would be much better to do all of this with just a single command (or better yet, run them automatically with continuous integration).
