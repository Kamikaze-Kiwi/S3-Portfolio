## What is frontend testing?

Frontend testing is the process of testing the user interface and functionality of a website or web application. This can include testing the layout of pages, testing for broken links, testing forms and user input, and testing the overall look and feel of the site.

## Why use frontend testing?
There are a lot of benefits to using frontend testing. If your frontend tests cover everything, you will always be able to ensure that no issues arise. Frontend tests can test both the layout and the logic. By testing the layout, you ensure the website will look good across all devices and browsers. You can also test the validation of forms, which will ensure users won't accidentally (or on purpose) send unexpected data to the connected API (although this obviously should not be accepted by the API anyhow).
