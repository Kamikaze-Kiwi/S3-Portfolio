## Language and framework choice

### Frontend
For the frontend, the programming language does not have to be considered as the only programming language natively supported by all browsers is Javascript.

There are a lot of frameworks to choose from, however. I cut this choice down to 4 frameworks. These are: React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte. The reason I excluded other frameworks mostly boils down to the fact that most of them are very young and/or not widely used. This is a problem because it will be hard to find any information/tutorials. While Svelte is also a relatively young framework, I included it anyway because I've seen it praised a lot[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021/?utm_source=social-share&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-webframe-love-dread)[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/front-end-frameworks/).

|  | **Vue.js** | **React** | **Angular** | **Svelte** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Documentation** | Good documentation with examples and live sandbox to test code. 8/10 | Decent tutorials but proper documentation is lacking. 6/10 | Quite bad documentation, hard to find what you are looking for. 3/10 | Good documentation and examples. Also a fancy interactive tutorial. 9/10 |
| **Complexity** | A bit complex at first and some code seems to add complexity for no reason. 6/10 |Not too complex and very readable. 8/10 | Most complex. Code seems unnecessarily complicated for even easy tasks. 4/10 | Not complex at all, can achieve the same as the other frameworks with less work/code while still being readable. 9/10 |
| **Popularity** | Somewhat popular but slowly growing. 6/10 | Very popular and still growing. 10/10 | Quite popular but declining in use. 7/10 | Not very popular but rapidly growing 5/10 |

### Backend
For the backend, the language choice is between C# with the ASP.net (core) framework and Java with one of its many backend frameworks.

I have quite a lot of experience with C# and ASP.net core. If I were to choose this language, I'd be able to make an app with more functionality while having to do less research as I would not have to learn a new language. In the other hand, however, I would really like to learn a new language instead of just making another backend with C# that would look virtually the same as last semester's. If I were to choose Java, I'd learn a new language which is very valuable. Doing this would mean I spend more time learning instead of just doing the same stuff I've already done twice. Java is also quite similar to C#, so it should not even take that long to get the hang of the language.

All in all I'm leaning towards learning Java.
