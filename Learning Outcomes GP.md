## 1. Web application
### - User-friendly
In the group project I made a distribution for which temperature should be displayed in which colour on the heatmap. To achieve this I initially used my own preferences, and then I consulted the other group members for some minor adjustments.

### - Full-stack
In the group project I worked on a frontend to display temperature/humidity data using Vue.js. We ended up scrapping this idea, however, after a meeting with the project-leader.

## 3. Agile method
In the group project we use a [Notion](https://right-metacarpal-459.notion.site/Dashboard-S3-Groep-3-a0a557bce28b4c35ba0b1655da06f22f), which is an alternative to Trello. In here we have our roadmap, user stories, documents and more.
