## 1. Web application
### - User-friendly
In the group project I made a distribution for which temperature should be displayed in which colour on the heatmap. To achieve this I initially used my own preferences, and then I consulted the other group members for some minor adjustments.

### - Full-stack
In the group project I worked on a frontend to display temperature/humidity data using VueJs. We ended up scrapping this idea, however, after a meeting with the project-leader.
