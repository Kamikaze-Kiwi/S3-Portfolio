## 1. Web application
### - User-friendly
In the group project I made a distribution for which temperature should be displayed in which colour on the heatmap. To achieve this I initially used my own preferences, and then I consulted the other group members for some minor adjustments.

### - Full-stack
In the group project I worked on a frontend to display temperature/humidity data using Vue.js. We ended up scrapping this idea, however, after a meeting with the project-leader.

I also worked on the heatmap together with Rick, which we made using HighCharts.

Furthermore, I worked with Rens to receive the data from the MQTT broker and to send this data over to a database. We achieved this using a C# API which listens to the MQTT broker. Using this API it's also possible to view the current status of the API and the broker.

## 3. Agile method
In the group project we use a [Notion](https://right-metacarpal-459.notion.site/Dashboard-S3-Groep-3-a0a557bce28b4c35ba0b1655da06f22f), which is an alternative to Trello. In here we have our roadmap, user stories, documents and more.

| ![User stories sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84376526/164202907-e209347f-5025-4966-9314-caedc814cf5c.png)   | ![notion roadmap sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84376526/164204103-0b2dc7c2-1c76-458f-ba72-f82149340b52.png)   |

| _^ A small sample of our user stories._ | _^ A small sample of our roadmap, with each entry containing more details and a definition of done when pressed._ |
<br>

We also have (atleast) a stand-up and a stand-down every day so we always know what the other team members are currently working on and to review eachothers work. At the start of each sprint we select all the user stories that we want to work on for that sprint and divide them among us. At the end of each sprint we do a sprint review with the product owner and a sprint retrospective.

## 5. Cultural differences and ethics

## Ethics

### What is ethics in software engineering?

###  Why is ethics important in software engineering?

###  What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work?

###  How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers?

### Which ethical aspects play a role in your project?

### Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?


## Culture

### What is culture?

### Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences?

### Can you give examples for cultural differences that you have experienced in your study or life? How do you explain these differences?

### What is your culture?

## 6. Requirements and design
We asked for feedback on our products to ensure we created something which is as close as possible to whatever the stakeholder envisioned. We applied this feedback to better our products.
<br>

## 7. Business processes
| ![Business process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84376526/169815643-b14fc448-b26b-4365-bfe7-6d9445a06598.png) |

| _^ The business process for a hypothetical order picking process. We chose this hypothetical process because we found it difficult to visualize a process for our group project. After discussing this with Marc we came to the conclusion that we should use another business or a hypothetical business to visualize a process instead. We chose an order picking business because Rens does orderpicking for his job, while Rick is creating an orderpicking system for his individual project. <hr> We created this using Engage Process Modeler, as we already had experience with this tool from the first semester._ |


## 8. Professional
As described in [3. Agile method](#3-agile-method), we commit ourselves to the scrum methodology as we hold daily stand-ups and stand-downs, as well as sprint reviews etc.

I always try to communicate professionally and in a timely manner with my group members, as well as with the product owners. For example if I'm unable to make it or if I'm a bit later. I also communicate well about the project itself, by asking for help whenever I require it and also by offering my help to whoever needs it.

Whenever a group member is unable to join in with the daily stand-up/stand-down, we make sure it is possible to join the meeting virtually, so they will still be able to track our progress as well as share their own.
