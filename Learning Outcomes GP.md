## 1. Web application
### - User-friendly
In the group project I made a distribution for which temperature should be displayed in which colour on the heatmap. To achieve this I initially used my own preferences, and then I consulted the other group members for some minor adjustments.

### - Full-stack
In the group project I worked on a frontend to display temperature/humidity data using Vue.js. We ended up scrapping this idea, however, after a meeting with the project-leader.

I also worked on the heatmap together with Rick, which we made using HighCharts.

Furthermore, I worked with Rens to receive the data from the MQTT broker and to send this data over to a database. We achieved this using a C# API which listens to the MQTT broker. Using this API it's also possible to view the current status of the API and the broker.

## 3. Agile method
In the group project we use a [Notion](https://right-metacarpal-459.notion.site/Dashboard-S3-Groep-3-a0a557bce28b4c35ba0b1655da06f22f), which is an alternative to Trello. In here we have our roadmap, user stories, documents and more.

| _^ A small sample of our user stories._ | _^ A small sample of our roadmap, with each entry containing more details and a definition of done when pressed._ |
<br>

We also have (atleast) a stand-up and a stand-down every day so we always know what the other team members are currently working on and to review eachothers work. At the start of each sprint we select all the user stories that we want to work on for that sprint and divide them among us. At the end of each sprint we do a sprint review with the product owner and a sprint retrospective.

## 6. Requirements and design
We asked for feedback on our products to ensure we created something which is as close as possible to whatever the stakeholder envisioned. We applied this feedback to better our products.
